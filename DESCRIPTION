Description: 'darthtools' provides tools developed by the Decision Analysis in R
    for Technologies in Health ('DARTH') Workgroup to build and analyze model-based
    cost-effectiveness analyses, including cohort Markov, partitioned survival,
    and microsimulation models. It also includes utilities for survival modeling,
    probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), and visualization (CEAC, EVPI, ELC).
