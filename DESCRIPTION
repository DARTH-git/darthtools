Description: Tools for decision-analytic cost-effectiveness modeling in R.
  Provides functions to build and analyze cohort Markov, partitioned survival,
  and microsimulation models; utilities for survival modeling and probabilistic
  sensitivity analysis (PSA); and visualization of cost-effectiveness
  acceptability curves (CEAC), expected value of perfect information (EVPI),
  and expected loss curves (ELC). Developed by the Decision Analysis in R for
  Technologies in Health ('DARTH') workgroup. See
